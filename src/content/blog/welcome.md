# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome! This is the first post on my new blog built with **Astro 5**. I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings with you.

## Why Astro 5?

I chose Astro 5 for this blog because:

- **Performance**: Ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Modern Development**: Built with the latest web standards
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple UI frameworks
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API and great documentation

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to write about:

- Web development tutorials
- Best practices and patterns
- Tool and framework reviews
- Personal projects and experiments

## Code Examples

Here's an example of code highlighting with Astro:

```astro
---
const pageTitle = "My Page";
---
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{pageTitle}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Stay Tuned
